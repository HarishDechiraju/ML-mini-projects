Stock market clustering uing K means algorithm and PCA dimensional analysis

Used Quandl API to get the data and did some cleaning of the data, and some fine tuning before normalising with the help of a pipeline and using K means clustering algorithm to divide it into clusters

Used Google Collab to complete the project and comments have been added at regular intervals as well for ease of work purpose

NOTE- The API key has been resetted and for unlimited access of WIKI/PRICES create a free account on Quandl.com without which the number of calls would be restricted to 50
