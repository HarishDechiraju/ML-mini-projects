Stock market clustering uing K means algorithm and PCA dimensional analysis

Used Quandl API to get the data and did some cleaning of the data, and some fine tuning before normalising with the help of a pipeline and using K means clustering algorithm to divide it into clusters

Used Google Collab to complete the project and comments have been added at regular intervals as well for ease of work purpose
